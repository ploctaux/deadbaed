i never really talked about my computer so lets change that  

my computer is a **lenovo thinkpad x1 carbon (3rd generation)** aka the 2015 version  
the first model appeared in 2012 or some shit like that and it got better and better (afaik the first ones were bad)  

so i got the 2015 model, a couple of weeks before the announcement of the 2016 version (i didn't know at the time), and it cost me a **FUCKING _LOT_ OF MONEY**  
the computer itself cost me like **1400€** and i replaced the ssd (128gb stock) with a 512gb one for **200€**, i did it seperatly because lenovo would have asked 500€ more if i did it through them.  
so i have a _(almost)_ **1700€** laptop that is wayy fucking more expensive than it should, and i got mocked a lot cause i don't have a graphics card.

now specs, cause specs fucking matter _right_?  
**cpu**: Intel® Core™ i5-5200U CPU @ 2.20GHz × 4  
**gpu**: Intel® HD Graphics 5500  
**ram**: 8 gigs (non removable)  
**ssd**: 128gb m2 stock (512gb m2 current)  
**display**: 14 inch 1920x1080 good looking display (to me)  
**wifi**: Intel Corporation Wireless 7265  
**bluetooth**: bluetooth 4.0  
**os**: windows 10 home (stock)  
**webcam**: 720p webcam + mic (now covered with tape)  
**battery**: fucking good (like 9/10 hours with vim/chromium on arch, and like 7+ ish hours on windows with softcore work) (not removeable)  
**keyboard**: i got mine in qwerty (the keyboard is backlit in 2 modes)  
**trackpad**: pretty good, you even got the trackball (the red thing in the middle of the keyboard) and the buttons from the ibm laptops (very useful)  
**fingerprint reader**: almost never use it, useful in bios, works good on windows, bad on arch  

pics now! (_i know you came for the pics_)  
note: the pics were taken in july 2016, and i was testing ubuntu 16.04 (terrible idea don't do that)

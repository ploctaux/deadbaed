my blog

made with jekyll

the site should be at [db.philippeloctaux.com](http://db.philippeloctaux.com)

## dev
this is for phil, cause he forgets all the time how to install jekyll.

`gem install jekyll bundler` to install the jekyll itself.  
`bundle exec jekyll serve 8002` to test the blog.  
`./scripts/publish.sh` to deploy the blog and to publish it on the server.

is that clear phil?
